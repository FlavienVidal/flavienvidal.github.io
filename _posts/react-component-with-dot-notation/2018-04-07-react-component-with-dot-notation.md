**Did Paris Help Shape Jazz? A Curious Connection Across the Atlantic**

I grew up in Paris, a city that shaped me in so many ways. At the same time, I’ve always been drawn to the spirit of jazz—especially New Orleans jazz and cool jazz. So, naturally, I found myself wondering: could there be a link between jazz and Paris? It turns out, there just might be! Paris could have played a surprising role in what eventually became jazz in New Orleans.

To understand this connection, we need to go back to the late 19th century. Around this time, European music education underwent a significant shift—improvisation was removed from the curriculum in classical music schools. Before this change, improvisation was a common skill among musicians like Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Haydn, and Liszt. All of them could take a melody and spin it into something new on the spot. But then, the role of the composer became dominant, and musicians turned into more rigid interpreters of written scores.

Yet music, as a living art, doesn't like to stay confined. And so, it made its way across the Atlantic and found a new voice. Jazz emerged as a unique blend of African musical traditions with European structures—bringing improvisation back to center stage. While we often trace jazz’s birth to early 20th-century New Orleans, specifically the Storyville district, the roots might extend much further back—to 18th-century Paris.

The unlikely story begins on July 28, 1794, at Place de la Concorde in Paris. On this day, Maximilien Robespierre, a key figure of the French Revolution, was executed by guillotine, marking the end of the "Reign of Terror." The next day, Paris celebrated. Shops reopened, people filled the streets, and a new kind of energy flowed through the city. In the Tuileries Garden, young Parisians invented a lively new dance to a playful, improvisational style of music.

This dance, full of joy and liberation, quickly became popular throughout France—and eventually made its way to French colonies, including Louisiana. The dance became known as the *quadrille des Tuileries*. When French plantation owners brought this dance to Louisiana, they performed it in front of enslaved Africans, who initially found it amusing and even imitated it as a way of mocking their masters. Over time, this imitation evolved into something entirely new: the *cakewalk*, a dance that combined the European quadrille with African rhythms.

Fast forward to 1900, in a brothel in Storyville, New Orleans, where a pianist plays a lively version of the cakewalk. The tune? It might remind you of Scott Joplin's *The Entertainer*. This blend of African and European influences, born out of the improvisational spirit, found fertile ground in the vibrant nightlife of Storyville, giving birth to a new style of music.

But there's more to the story. As these musical influences spread through the brothels of Storyville, a new word entered the scene: *jazz*. According to one story, the term may have originated from the perfume that women in the brothels used—Jasmine. They would sing out, “Jaaaaasmine, Jaaaasmine,” to attract clients, and the word stuck. In fact, early records even labeled this music as “Jas Band” or “Jass Band.” Eventually, the "s" was replaced by a "z" to avoid cheeky graffiti artists who would alter the posters to read “ass music.” And so, the music and the name evolved together.

Could Paris and its dance of liberation have played a role in shaping the early rhythms and spirit of jazz? It’s possible! The transatlantic journey of music is full of unexpected twists, and this one might just connect the City of Light with the soulful sounds of New Orleans.
