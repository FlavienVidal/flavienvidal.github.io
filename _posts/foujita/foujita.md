A Japanese in France: Foujita, the star painter of the Roaring Twenties
Arriving in Montparnasse in 1913, the Japanese painter Tsugouharu Foujita [1][2] established himself as one of the most daring and avant-garde painters of the French capital, and became, in the euphoria of the Roaring Twenties, a star adored by the Parisian elite. In this article we begin by briefly recalling what the Roaring Twenties in Paris were like, and then we will look more specifically at Foujita's life, his settlement in France, his wild artistic adventure and his contribution to the School of Paris.
