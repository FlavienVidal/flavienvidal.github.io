<p>
Beyond work and data, my heart beats to the rhythm of art and music. Painting and drawing have always been my passion—when I’m not diving into data, I turn to painting and drawing pieces that reflect how I see the world. Music, especially the improvisational spirit of jazz, has always been a guiding force in my creative process. I invite you to explore some of my work.
