<p>Greetings! ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>
I am Flavien, a final year MSc student in computer science at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, where I mainly study topics related to machine learning such as natural language processing, computer vision and reinforcement learning. Beforehand, I graduated from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) where I specialized in data science.
</p>
<p>
During my studies, I have worked on various projects among which pose estimation, human action recognition, face labelling, sentiment analysis or bandits for recommendation. My current research aims at mitigating the popularity bias in session-based recommendation used in the context of anonymous data, emphasizing the diversity, novelty and serendipity of the recommended videos as well as the coverage of the catalog.
</p>
<p>
Outside of Ã‰cole Polytechnique, I interned at Lydia in the Summer of 2021 to conduct their personal finance management project, and at Dailymotion in the Summer of 2022 to work on their video-to-video recommender system. I was also a Research Student at Idemia.
</p>
<p>
Beyond work and data, my heart beats to the rhythm of art and music. Painting and drawing have always been my passionâ€”when Iâ€™m not diving into data, I turn to painting and drawing pieces that reflect how I see the world. Music, especially the improvisational spirit of jazz, has always been a guiding force in my creative process. I invite you to explore some of <a href="https://flavienvidal.github.io/art_gallery/">my work.</a>
