<p>Greetings! ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>
I am Flavien, a Machine Learning Scientist at TripAdvisor. My work includes designing and conducting A/B tests, enhancing their precision with Bayesian methods and covariate adjustment to deliver faster and more accurate online experiments. I have collaborated with the customer analytics team to automate feedback analysis, driving key business strategies. Additionally, I have optimized CPC bidding and ROAS for our SEM campaigns, contributing to improved financial outcomes.</p>
<p>
I hold an MSc in Computer Science from Ã‰cole Polytechnique, with a focus on statistics and machine learning areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. Prior to that, I graduated from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), where I specialized in data science and business analytics. During my studies, I have worked on various projects among which pose estimation, human action recognition, face labelling, sentiment analysis or bandits for recommendation.</p>
<p>
Before joining TripAdvisor, I interned at Lydia in Summer 2021, where I developed fraud detection solutions and conducted their personal finance management project. In Summer 2022, I interned at Dailymotion, focusing on their video-to-video recommender system. My research aimed at mitigating popularity bias in session-based recommendations used in the context of anonymous data, while enhancing diversity, novelty, serendipity, and catalog coverage. Additionally, I was a Research Student at Idemia.</p>
<p>
Beyond work and data, my heart beats to the rhythm of art and music. Painting and drawing have always been my passionâ€”when Iâ€™m not diving into data, I turn to painting and drawing pieces that reflect how I see the world. Music, especially the improvisational spirit of jazz, has always been a guiding force in my creative process. Traveling and exploring new cultures is another passion of mine. My adventures include hiking in Vietnam, sailing in the Grenadines, and ice climbing in Iceland.
